Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.
A healthy mind lives in a healthy body.
Rest when you're weary. Refresh and renew yourself, your body, your mind, your spirit.
Small steps in the right direction can turn out to be the biggest step of your life.
You are capable of more than you know.
Progress, not perfection.
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Take time to make your soul happy.
Breathe in peace, breathe out stress.
Your mental health is a priority. Your happiness is essential.
It's okay to take a break. It's okay to rest.
You don't have to be productive every moment of every day.
Mental health is not a luxury. It's a necessity.
Be gentle with yourself. You're doing the best you can.
Your worth is not determined by your productivity.
